## **Project Title:** **ChainMuse**

### **Vision:**

*Unify digital identity, reputation, and social discovery through NFTs across all blockchains.*

---

### **Inspiration**

The future of blockchain is undoubtedly **multi-chain**. But blockchains today still act like isolated data islands. While ERC-20 token bridges have made some progress in interoperability, **NFTs remain siloed**, despite their value as identity, status, and utility assets (PFPs, land, game items, membership passes, etc.).

Imagine holding Bored Apes on Ethereum or being a legendary Axie player—your digital identity ends there. There's no recognition or status when you switch to Solana, Avalanche, Aptos, or other chains. That’s where **ChainMuse** comes in: to connect these fragmented identities and build **cross-chain recognition** and **community synergy** across NFT ecosystems.

### **What It Does**

**ChainMuse** is a **cross-chain NFT aggregator and credential bridge** that serves as a one-stop platform to view, track, and showcase your NFT identity and connect socially—regardless of the blockchain. Its core features include:

1. **Unified NFT Gallery**
   Connect wallets across **Ethereum, Solana, Eluvio, Avalanche, Aptos**, and more to aggregate and display your entire NFT collection on a **single page**. Track value, collections, and trends using real-time **analytics** and **collection points**.

2. **Decentralized Social Layer**
   Discover and engage with fellow collectors or gamers across chains. View their on-chain achievements, follow profiles, and build your reputation across multiple ecosystems. Think of it as the **Instagram for NFTs**, but decentralized and chain-agnostic.

3. **Credential & Credit Engine**
   Issue **upgradable soulbound tokens (SBTs)** on Ethereum, Solana, Aptos, and others as verified credentials. These SBTs represent ownership, reputation, or accomplishments. Later, through DAO governance, we’ll introduce **rarity scoring** and **collection credit**, enabling undercollateralized lending, exclusive access, or cross-platform trust.

### **How We Built It**

* **Frontend:** React.js, TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind, ChakraUI, Bootstrap 4
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Web3 Services:**

  * Wallets: Metamask, WalletConnect
  * Libraries: Web3.js, Ethers.js, Web3-React
* **Blockchain SDKs:**

  * Solana: `@solana/web3.js` (Phantom wallet)
  * Eluvio: Eluvio SDK (video NFT integration)
  * **Aptos:** Aptos SDK & Wallet Adapter for wallet integration and fetching NFTs
* **Database:** CockroachDB (structured user info: wallet addresses, profiles, etc.)

### **What’s Next**

* Speed and performance optimization for fetching wallet-based NFT collections.
* Expand chain support: **Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism**, and deepen **Aptos** integration.
* Build the **cross-chain credit scoring system** and collection analytics engine.
* Define a **cross-chain NFT credential standard** (proxy on Ethereum to hold foreign NFT data).
* Launch **DAO governance** to manage rarity scoring and community voting.
* Grow a **collector-driven community** with gamified participation and rewards.
