## **Project Title:** **ChainMuse**

### **Vision:**

*Unify digital identity, reputation, and social discovery through NFTs across all blockchains.*

---

### **Inspiration**

The future of blockchain is undoubtedly **multi-chain**. But blockchains today still act like isolated data islands. While ERC-20 token bridges have made some progress in interoperability, **NFTs remain siloed**, despite their value as identity, status, and utility assets (PFPs, land, game items, membership passes, etc.).

Imagine holding Bored Apes on Ethereum or being a legendary Axie player—your digital identity ends there. There's no recognition or status when you switch to Solana, Avalanche, Aptos, or other chains. That’s where **ChainMuse** comes in: to connect these fragmented identities and build **cross-chain recognition** and **community synergy** across NFT ecosystems.

---

### **What It Does**

**ChainMuse** is a **cross-chain NFT aggregator and credential bridge** that serves as a one-stop platform to view, track, and showcase your NFT identity and connect socially—regardless of the blockchain. Its core features include:

1. **Unified NFT Gallery**
   Connect wallets across **Ethereum, Solana, Eluvio, Avalanche, Aptos**, and more to aggregate and display your entire NFT collection on a **single page**. Track value, collections, and trends using real-time **analytics** and **collection points**.

2. **Decentralized Social Layer**
   Discover and engage with fellow collectors or gamers across chains. View their on-chain achievements, follow profiles, and build your reputation across multiple ecosystems. Think of it as the **Instagram for NFTs**, but decentralized and chain-agnostic.

3. **Credential & Credit Engine**
   Issue **upgradable soulbound tokens (SBTs)** on Ethereum, Solana, Aptos, and others as verified credentials. These SBTs represent ownership, reputation, or accomplishments. Later, through DAO governance, we’ll introduce **rarity scoring** and **collection credit**, enabling undercollateralized lending, exclusive access, or cross-platform trust.
